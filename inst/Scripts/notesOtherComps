There were 32 other GO protein complexes gotten by grepping for the term 
"[Cc]omplex" in the description (definition) of each GO node and then parsing
by hand. Of these 32 GO complexes (the GO id's are stored as the character
vector xtGO.rda in the data directory) 20 complexes became trivial when 
restricted to yeast genes, and the other twelve are characterized by the
function checkComplex(). 

5 were already attained by the getGOInfo() function. Two are sub-complexes of 
Mips protein complexes. Two are larger complexes containing one Mips complex
(Mips-160) and one Gavin Complex (Gavin236).

Three complexes did not have any proper inclusion properties. Thus 5 
extra protein complexes should be investigated thoroughly and either 
added to the ScISI or ignored.

The two super-complexes are GO:0000145; GO:0030127
The three others are: GO:0000776; GO:0005786; GO:0000943
