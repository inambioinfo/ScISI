Hi,
  I really want to push on this to the point where we at least have a workable, defensible validation tool.

  As I see it we can use:
  1) Y2H, here the major problem (Tony, any progress) is that any genes/proteins that were not either bait or prey will cause havoc. So we need to know the prey populations for all experiments.

     Given that we can do some things, they are mostly aimed at seeing how close to connected, given the data, the Y2H graph is. I believe that it cannot be merely a count, but it has to somehow reflect complex size (or little complexes will look better).

  2) predicted interactions. Tony had a paper - any progress on that front? Last we spoke Ting was going to get us more data.
    We could also take all the Y2H data and use the PFAM/SMART domains to see which domain combinations seem to be showing up. Has anyone done something that simple?

  3) Using the output of apComplex the SBMH predictions from one of the three (and soon to be four) runs against the final ScISI. Here we are looking to see if the SBMH is larger than a prediction (and the prediction would need to be modified for what was tested).

  4) The new Bader paper uses SL data to identify likely complex co-members (at least that is one way to think of it). They look at pairs of genes that have lots of common SL partners and claim that those pairs are related. We could use that same data, but do something a bit more graph based.

 Comparisons, as Denise did to MIPS or GO might also be useful. 

 Other suggestions?

----------------------

For Tony (by Tony):

1. Generate new ScISI - write a script to generate a new ScISI and provide documentation.
        Two working models: an ScISI to be used for simulatorAPMS where no sub-complexes are available
                            an ScISI to be used for SL where sub-complexes are necessary
        Whatever the methodology, we should be consistent. Either we delete all sub-complexes bi-laterally 
        or we should not remove any (unless there is some firmer justification as to why we do so)

--> The new script to generate the ScISI is in place. The SL paradigm is now the working model.

        1a. I need to re-tool the vignette since our working paradigm 
            has changed. There needs to be a large number of changes to the
            ScISI.Rnw, but that will wait.

        1b. Write Scripts to generate summary statistics for the new ScISI. 
                (The old ones are now obsolete as we have chosen to use a new paradigm)

                --> This has been started but seems to be trickier than I thought...need to think about this 
                    some more...
                --> This is done. The script is entitled sumStats.R in the inst/Scripts/ directory. It generates
                    all the redundant complexes and sub-complexes either within repositories or across repositories.

                        **Need to create Man page

        1c. Put these new summary stats into the table of ScISI.Rnw

                --> Done

        1d. I had make some minor modifications to a couple of functions so I need to update each man page as well.

                --> Done

        1e. Streamline script to generate the .html files.

	

2. Create images for ScISI paper; also some distribution graphs for y2h v. ScISI as well as pathway data. Awaiting
   the exact structure from Denise so I can generated ap-ms co-membership graphs as well as the some exact graphs.

--> I have graphNEL for each of the crystal structures Denise sent me. There are two protein complexes that we 
    have a definitive topology. For each constituent protein, I looked in the Y2H data and generated a bait to
    prey directed graph. Unfortunately, only one protein is found as a bait, and futhermore, it had only one hit. 
    I also cross referenced these proteins with the predicted interactions and found one interaction from each
    protein complex. The graphNEL's are located in the inst/extdata/ directory. They have the letter "G" before 
    the .rda. There is a script called ckCrystStruct.R located in the inst/Scripts/ directory which checks 
    the interaction in y2h data and ppipred.

        2a. I will generate the co-membership graphNEL's of these objects as well since apComplex identified
            them exactly.

                --> Done 
                
                --> I have a new idea for the generation of these graphs...will see which is better.

        2b. Put some words into the script as well as analyze what these data mean. apComplex can identify 
            these complexes under certain conditions but even then the y2h data as well as predictions are
            too sparse to validate at this point.
        
                -->In progress

3. Encode the hypergeometric sampling scheme as well as connected component scheme.
        --> The mean degree statistic has been encoded, but I need to test before I check it into SVN.
        --> The two graph statistics (mean vertex degree and edge proportion is encoded)
                
                3a. I will generate a script to get the summary statistics        

                        --> Done...called the graphSumStats.R in the inst/Scripts/ directory

                                *** Need to create man pages for the new graph statistics scripts

                        --> I have written an .Rnw file that shows how to use the graph summary 
                            statistic functions. It is called graphStatistics.Rnw

                        --> All six of the graph statistics are encoded and fully generated. The
                            .Rnw file details how to generate these statistics.

                3b. Analysis...in progress


4. Determine protein complexes contained in nuclues.
	
	4a. Find all nodes which are children of the nucleus node in GO.
                
                --> The nucleus GO nodes is "GO:0005634". There are 1127 yeast genes/features that have been directly
                    annotated to the term nucleus. A few questions that need to be addressed-

                        ?1 - Are there proteins which are entirely nucleus bound? If yes, then each protein complex
                             to which they belong is also entirely nucleus bound.

                        ?2 - Are there proteins which are entirely outside nucleus? This gives us the protein complexes
                             which do can eliminate automatically if ?1 is negative.

                        ?3 - How should we categorize complexes if ?1 and ?2 are both false?

                --> I have read the paper of Huh WK, et al. concerning the localization of certain ORF's within sub-
                    components of the yeast cell. The answer to ?1 and ?2 is (at least right now) false. We do not 
                    have 100% certainty that a certain protein (ORF) exists only within the nucleus or without. To this
                    end we need to find some strategy as to how to use the localization data.

                --> One strategy is to use the localization data directly. It is necessary (but certainly not sufficient)
                    that protein co-members need to have the same localization for at least one sub-component of the cell.
                    An indirect method would be to use to localization data to cut the y2h data (as well as the PPI) data.
                    This way, we get more confidant interaction data to validate the ScISI.
 
                --> The localization data is contained in the inst/extdata/ directory called "localization.rda"
	
	4b. Seach for "nucleus" in MIPS repository

                --> Mips does not have (any obvious way anyhow) a localization of proteins nor genes. We have a list
                    of genes which are annotated by nucleus from GO; we can make a decision on how to use this 
                    information with respect to MIPS.

                --> It looks like we can either use the localization data on the Mips protein complexes either directly 
                    or indirectly as above. 

	4c. Search literature.

                --> Paper of interest: Huh WK, et al. (2003) Global analysis of protein localization in budding yeast. Nature 425(6959):686-91
                        

5. Download and parse pathway data from Kegg and SGD. 
        I have already used the KEGG R-data package to cull the information between pathway and orfs
                --> An incidence matrix for Orfs and Pathways is in the inst/extdata/ directory

        I have downloaded and parsed the .tab file from SGD.
                --> Need to get the data into an incidence matrix and loaded into the package.
                        --> Done...in the inst/extdata/ directory

                                *** Create man pages.

        Preliminary stats show that this data is sparser than y2h.

6. Run simulations on GO and MIPS data. Confirm the viability of apComplex.

7. Work on the paper.
