Hi,
  I really want to push on this to the point where we at least have a workable, defensible validation tool.

  As I see it we can use:
  1) Y2H, here the major problem (Tony, any progress) is that any genes/proteins that were not either bait or prey will cause havoc. So we need to know the prey populations for all experiments.

     Given that we can do some things, they are mostly aimed at seeing how close to connected, given the data, the Y2H graph is. I believe that it cannot be merely a count, but it has to somehow reflect complex size (or little complexes will look better).

  2) predicted interactions. Tony had a paper - any progress on that front? Last we spoke Ting was going to get us more data.
    We could also take all the Y2H data and use the PFAM/SMART domains to see which domain combinations seem to be showing up. Has anyone done something that simple?

  3) Using the output of apComplex the SBMH predictions from one of the three (and soon to be four) runs against the final ScISI. Here we are looking to see if the SBMH is larger than a prediction (and the prediction would need to be modified for what was tested).

  4) The new Bader paper uses SL data to identify likely complex co-members (at least that is one way to think of it). They look at pairs of genes that have lots of common SL partners and claim that those pairs are related. We could use that same data, but do something a bit more graph based.

 Comparisons, as Denise did to MIPS or GO might also be useful. 

 Other suggestions?

----------------------

For Tony (by Tony):

1. Generate new ScISI - write a script to generate a new ScISI and provide documentation.
        Two working models: an ScISI to be used for simulatorAPMS where no sub-complexes are available
                            an ScISI to be used for SL where sub-complexes are necessary
        Whatever the methodology, we should be consistent. Either we delete all sub-complexes bi-laterally 
        or we should not remove any (unless there is some firmer justification as to why we do so)

--> The new script to generate the ScISI is in place. The SL paradigm is now the working model.

        1a. I need to re-tool the vignette since our working paradigm 
            has changed. There needs to be a large number of changes to the
            ScISI.Rnw, but that will wait.

        1b. Write Scripts to generate summary statistics for the new ScISI. 
                (The old ones are now obsolete as we have chosen to use a new paradigm)

        1c. Put these new summary stats into the table of ScISI.Rnw

        1d. I had make some minor modifications to a couple of functions so I need to update each man page as well.

        1e. Streamline script to generate the .html files.

	

2. Create images for ScISI paper; also some distribution graphs for y2h v. ScISI as well as pathway data. Awaiting
   the exact structure from Denise so I can generated ap-ms co-membership graphs as well as the some exact graphs.

3. Encode the hypergeometric sampling scheme as well as connected component scheme.

4. Determine protein complexes contained in nuclues.
	
	4a. Find all nodes which are children of the nucleus node in GO.
	
	4b. Seach for "nuclues" in MIPS repository

	4c. Search literature.

5. Download and parse pathway data from Kegg and SGD. 
        I have already used the KEGG R-data package to cull the information between pathway and orfs
        I have downloaded and parsed the .tab file from SGD.
        Preliminary stats show that this data is sparser than y2h.

6. Run simulations on GO and MIPS data. Confirm the viability of apComplex.

7. Work on the paper.
